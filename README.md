# OpampBoostPedal

## Description
This is a simple cheap op-amp boost pedal meant for use with guitar [Include cutoff frequencies, gain, and phase shift here]. The form factor is intended to be very small. Included you will find the eagle files for the board, wiring diagrams, finished photos, pspice simulation files, and a bill of materials to estimate the total cost.
